# Store Zsh Functions in a Directory

1. Create a `~/.zfunc` Directory
2. In your `.zshrc`, add the following block to the top:

```bash
for file in ~/.zfunc/**; do
  autoload $file;
done
```

3. Add a files containing zsh functions into your `~/.zshrc` directory

For example, create a file named: `lg`

Add the contents:

```bash
ls | grep -i "$1"
```

Now you can search your current directory with:

```bash
lg foo
```
