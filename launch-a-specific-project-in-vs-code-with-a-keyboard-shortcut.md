# Launch a Specific Project in VS Code with a Keyboard Shortcut

I have a few [[VS Code]] projects that I open all the time. In your `karabiner.edn`, define a template for VS Code:

```clojure
:templates {
    :code-project "open -a 'Visual Studio Code' %s"
```

I use a simlayer on my `'` key to trigger code projects:

```clojure
:simlayers {;
             :quote-mode {:key :quote}
```

With the following setup, pressing `'+c` will open my config directory. `'+a` will open my automatoes directory and so on:

```clojure
{:des "quote mode"
    :rules [:quote-mode
            [:c [:code-project "~/.config"]]
            [:z [:code-project "~/.zfunc"]]
            [:a [:code-project "~/projects/automatoes.com"]]
            [:l [:code-project "~/projects/automatoes.com/_layouts"]]
            ;
            ]}
```
